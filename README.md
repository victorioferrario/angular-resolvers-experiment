# Using resolvers to load data in angular. 

Very interesting concept.

In addition with playing with Ngrx, I was experimenting using resolvers.  It is a very interesting concept, where a route will not load until the resolver returns. In this repo, I am testing against a particular route, in simulates making an http service call, and acts accordinly. Pretty interesting stuff.

Also played with Ngrx. Which, honestly, it is insanity, how much boilerplate code you need to generate, to get up and running.
